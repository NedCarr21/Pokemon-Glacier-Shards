# Main method is "pbWonderTrade"
# Use this to call on the trade to start.
# If you would like to use optional arguments, call is:
# "pbWonderTrade(nickName, trainerName, trainerGender)"
# How It Works:
# - Map Scanning: The script comprehensively scans all maps in your game to gather
#   encounter data. For each encounter, it creates lists that track the available
#   Pokémon species and how often each of them can be encountered in your game.
#
# - Assigning "Weight": Every Pokémon is assigned a "weight" based on its availability
#   within the game. These weights play a crucial role in probability calculations.
#
# - Sorting by Rarity: The script categorizes Pokémon species into six rarity levels,
#   determined by their respective weights. It then proceeds to randomly select a rarity,
#   considering predefined rarity probabilities.
#
# - Selecting a Pokémon: Within the chosen rarity level, the script selects a random number.
#   It iterates through the list of Pokémon until it finds one whose weight meets or
#   exceeds the selected number. This chosen Pokémon becomes the selected trade option.
#
# Optional Blocklist and Allowlist Options:
# - Blocklist: This feature enables you to exclude specific Pokémon from being considered
#   for trade. The format is simple: [:POKEMON1, :POKEMON2].
#
# - Allowlist: You can use the Allowlist to increase the chances of encountering specific
#   Pokémon during trades. The format is as follows:
#   ALLOWLIST_POKEMON = {
#     :MELOETTA => 5,
#     :RATTATA => 10,
#     :PIKACHU => 30
#   }
#   The numbers represent the number of "chances" each Pokémon has for trade, which is
#   equivalent to their encounter frequency in the game.
#
# Optional Customization:
# - In the script, you'll find optional arguments to fine-tune the trading process:
#   - Nickname: You can specify a unique nickname for the traded Pokémon.
#   - Trainer Name: If desired, you can define the Trainer's name.
#   - Trainer Gender: Customizing the Trainer's gender is also an option.
# Please Note: If you provide specific arguments, these values will be used for all
# NPC-initiated trades. Alternatively, you can leave them blank, and the script will
# generate random values for you.
#
# - Additionally, the script includes male and female name lists for Trainers in the
#   settings file. If you don't specify a Trainer name, the script will randomly select
#   one from these lists and determine the Trainer's gender accordingly.
#
# - You can enable or disable Pokémon nicknames using the script. When enabled, a random
# name from the list is assigned as the Pokémon's nickname. When disabled, the Pokémon
# retains its original name unless a nickname is defined within the method call.
#
# Additional Features:
# - Trade operations occur within the PC interface, offering access to your party, just
#   like the standard PC screen.
# - Full compatibility with the Charm Case and Trading Charm is integrated into the script.
# - The script includes a default greeting message, which adapts to the Trainer's gender
# and modifies the text color accordingly.
#
# How to Use:
# Simply initiate the Wonder Trade by calling the pbWonderTrade method. Customize the trade
# using optional arguments: pbWonderTrade(nickName, trainerName, trainerGender)
