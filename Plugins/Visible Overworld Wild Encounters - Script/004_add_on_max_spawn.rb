# You can use this add-on to set a maximal number of wild Encounters Events
# that can be spawned on the map at the same time.
# Use the parameter DEFAULT_MAX_SPAWN (see below) to set the limit of overworld pokeEvents at the same time.
# Use the parameter MAP_MAX_SPAWN (see below) to set specific limits for each map differently.

# FEATURES:
# * Stop more PokeEvent from spawning with the DEFAULT_MAX_SPAWN parameter and give exceptions for each map in MAP_MAX_SPAWN.


module VisibleEncounterSettings

  # DEFAULT_MAX_SPAWN is the max number of wild Encounters Events that can be spawned on the map at the same time.
  # <=0  - means infinite (no maximum)
  # >0   - equals maximum of wild encounters on all maps (that are not listed as exceptions in MAP_MAX_SPAWN below)

  MAP_MAX_SPAWN = [
    [9, 8],             # - means the maximal spawn limit is 5 on map with map_id 4
    #[map_id, limit],   # - add your specific map limits here. Don't forget to use a comma between your pairs.

  # MAP_MAX_SPAWN is a parameter that contains pairs of the form [map_id, limit], where each pair consists of the map_id of a map and the corresponding spawn limit of that map.
  # example: [ [4,5], [6,0] ]   means   "map with id 4 has spawn limit of 5 pokemons and map with id 6 has no spawn limit".
