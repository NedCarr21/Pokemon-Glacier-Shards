#                       ADD-ON: Reroll Spawn Tile
#                           by TrankerGolD
#===============================================================================

# Pokemon only spawn on allowed ground. This reduces the probability of spawning
# if there is only few grass around the player.

# This add on can be used to increase the probability, by checking more than only
# one random tile around the player.

# Set up to how many different tiles will be checked around the player in the
# parameter NO_OF_CHOSEN_TILES below. But be careful, it might produce lag with
# other scripts.

# Features
#  [*] stabilizes the probability of spawning on maps with low grass by choosing
#      another tile if the previous random chosen one does not allow spawning
#  [*] set the maximal number of tiles chosen for spawning in parameter
#      NO_OF_CHOSEN_TILES
#  [*] be careful, it might produce lag with other scripts

module VisibleEncounterSettings

  NO_OF_CHOSEN_TILES = 3 # default 1
  # Pokemon only spawn on allowed ground. This parameter needs to be an integer.
  # It says up to how many different, random tiles in SPAWN_RANGE to the player
  # will be checked for beeing allowed spawning ground.
  # = 0  - means that it will choose a random tile until one of them
  #       is possible to spawn a pokemon or all tiles in SPAWN_RANGE to the player were chosen
  #       (this will increase the spawn probability)
  #       (may cause lag with other scripts)
  # = 1  - means that only one random tile around the player will be chosen
  # > 1   - maximal number of chosen tiles to find a possible tile where a pokemon can spawn
  #         (the more you use, more performance needed)
